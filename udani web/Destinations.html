                <h2>Temple of The Tooth</h2>
                <p>Sri Dalada Maligawa, commonly known in English as the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, is a Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the Royal Palace Complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. The relic was historically held by Sinhalese kings.</p>
                <p>Bhikkhus of the two particular chapters, the Malwathu chapters and Asgiri chapters, conduct daily worship in the inner chamber of the temple. Rituals are performed three times daily: at dawn, at noon, and in the evenings. On Wednesdays, there is a symbolic bathing of the relic with a herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers called Nanumura Mangallaya; this holy water is believed to contain healing powers and is distributed to those present.</p>

                <h2>Nine Arch Bridge</h2>
                <p>Nine Arch Bridge, also called the Bridge in the Sky, is a viaduct bridge in Sri Lanka and one of the best examples of colonial-era railway construction in the country. The bridge was designed to accommodate a challenging nine-degree curve and steep gradient. Built entirely by local labor under British supervision, the construction faced significant logistical challenges, including difficult terrain and material transport. Completed in 1919, the bridge has since stood resilient, showcasing innovative engineering solutions.</p>

It is a historical, archaeological, and architectural heritage monument, which even after more than 432 years maintains a polished appearance due to extensive reconstruction work done by the Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka.</p>
